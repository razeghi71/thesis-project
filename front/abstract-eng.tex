In this thesis, we discuss the facility location problem in two dimensional space. Facility location problem, a.k.a $k$-center problem, is of great importance in computational geometry, operational research and data mining fields. The goal in this problem is to find an optimum placement for $k$ facilities on the plane, such that the cost for clients traveling to the nearest facility is minimized. Solving this problem in presence of outlier points has interested many researchers in recent years.

In this article, having explained the previous works on this subject, we present new algorithms for $k$-center problem with weighted outliers.
