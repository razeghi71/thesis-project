The number of applications that require authentication is increasing every day.  As we know choosing the same password for different services is considered as a security threat. So password-manager Softwares are a hot area. These Softwares introduce features such as password encryption, automatic password generation and provide Application Programming Interfaces.

One of the recent challenges of password-manager softwares is insecurity against keyloggers. Because if keylogging software is able to obtain your master password, the attacker will be able to access all of your other credentials.

In this thesis we proposed a new method for creating a password-manager software for GNU/Linux operating system secured againt keyloggers and other threats.
